Configure all of your external logs in only one place. Tired of trying to understand how slack, discord, and telegram work? Tired of creating a new webhook and a new application everytime you want to fire logs? This is for you!

## One yaml to rule them all

Configure your logs in one place.

## How it works

Configure YAML -> Make request to Crystal Sage ->  [Slack, Discord, Telegram, Your Mom]
